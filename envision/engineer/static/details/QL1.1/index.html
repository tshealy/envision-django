        <p><b>QL1.1   IMPROVE COMMUNITY QUALITY OF LIFE</b></p>
        <p>Intent: Improve the net quality of life of all communities affected by the project and mitigate negative impacts to communities.</p>
        <p>Metric: Measures taken to assess community needs and improve quality of life while minimizing negative impacts.</p>

        <h3>Levels of Achievement</h3>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Improved</h4>
                <p>(2) Internal focus. The project team has located and reviewed the most recent community planning information. Some, but not systematic, outreach to stakeholders and decision makers has taken place. Some relatively easy, but not particularly important or meaningful, changes made to the project. No serious adverse community effects are caused by the project. (A, B, C, D)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Enhanced</h4>
                <p>(5) Community linkages. More efforts to locate, review, assess, and incorporate the needs, goals, and plans of the host community to the project. Most potential negative adverse impacts of the project on the host community are reduced or eliminated. Key stakeholders are involved in the project decision-making process. (A, B, C, D)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Superior</h4>
                <p>(10) Broad community alignment. All community plans are reviewed and verified through stakeholder input. The project team works to achieve good project alignment with community plans, recognizing that the scope of the project is a limiting factor. Potential negative impacts on nearby affected communities are reduced or eliminated. (A, B, C, D)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Conserving</h4>
                <p>(20) Holistic assessment and collaboration. The project makes a positive contribution to the quality of life of the host and nearby affected communities. The project team makes a holistic assessment of community needs, goals, and plans, incorporating meaningful stakeholder input. Project meets or exceeds important identified community needs and long-term requirements for sustainability. Remaining adverse impacts are minimal, mostly accepted as reasonable trade-offs for benefits achieved. The project has broad community endorsement. (A, B, C, D, E)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-2 col-xs-15 loa-detail">
                <h4 class="loa-color">Restorative</h4>
                <p>(25) Community renaissance. Through rehabilitation of important community assets (e.g., upgraded and extended access, increased safety, improved environmental quality, and additional infrastructure capacity) the project substantially reinvigorates the host and nearby communities. Working in genuine collaboration with stakeholders and community decision makers, the project owner and the project team scope the project in a way that elevates community awareness and pride. Overall quality of life in these communities is markedly elevated. (A, B, C, D, E, F)</p>
