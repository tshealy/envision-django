        <p>Intent: Preserve floodplain functions by limiting development and the impacts of development to maintain water management capacities and capabilities.</p>
        <p>Metric: Efforts to avoid floodplains or maintain predevelopment floodplain functions.</p>

                <p><b>(2) Avoid or mitigate impacts.</b> Avoid or limit new development within the design frequency floodplain for waterways of all sizes, unless the project is water-dependent infrastructure that must cross or be adjacent to a waterway. Design water-dependent infrastructure to minimize floodplain impacts or waterway crossings. The project maintains pre-development floodplain storage and does not increase flood elevations. (A)</p>

Maintain or enhance vegetation and soil protection zones. Impacts from overall site development shall not decrease the capacity of the floodplain riparian vegetation and soil protection zone to support the desired vegetation. Take into consideration possible beneficial use of stormwater runoff. (A, B)</p>
